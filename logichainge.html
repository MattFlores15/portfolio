                Logichainge's SaaS platform intends to automate and streamline
                the order process for logistics service providers. The platform
                addresses the increasing administrative burdens experienced by
                logistic companies, allowing planners to add value for
                customers. With a self-learning module, the system enables fast
                order entry regardless of the customer's preferred method (email and/or any attachment).
                <br />
                <br />

                <p>As part of this platform, Logichanige entrusted me the task of
                designing and developing their Groupage Transport Management System (TMS) module. 
                The project involved designing and developing various elements, such as front-end flow, 
                wireframes, final designs, integration with back-end API endpoints, 
                and delivering high-quality, scalable code.

                    <p>In this document we have identified the different features that are required for the Groupage TMS system. 
                      We did this by utilizing both Persona and User Story to create a proper project plan. We categorized the features into two groups: Must Have & Should Have. 
                      This categorization is based on the MoSCoW analysis technique, which is used to prioritize project elements for efficiency. 
                      The Must Have features are essential for the system to function properly and are therefore the highest priority. 
                      The Should Have features are important but not critical, while the Could Have features are desirable but not necessary. 
                      The Won't Have features are not included in the project scope and will not be implemented.</p>

                 <h3>Introduction</h3>
                 
             
              <p>
                The design phase of the Groupage Transport Management System (TMS) module aimed to create a streamlined and automated 
                solution for logistics professionals. This phase involved various key elements, including sketches, wireframe design, 
                and an interactive prototype. Approaching the design phase after our research was completed was imperative in order to start working on 
                the main ideas we had in mind. We wanted to create a system that was easy to use, that was intuitive and that could be used by anyone,
                we were aware of our target audience and realised the short-comings of trying to integrate a new techonology into such a manually labored 
                process within the logistics industry.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>Creating a user-friendly, easy to use and built for skilled professionals was the goal of our design, which meant integrating both a professional look 
               and conservative design with a modern and intuitive interface. By automating the administrative process of the Groupage TMS system, we are aiming 
               to increase productivity for our users as well as standarize a more cohesive management of the Groupage Transport System.

            <div class="section">
        <h3>Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          Sketches were created as a foundation for the design phase. They served as initial representations of the module's
          layout and functionality. Take a look at the sketches below to get an idea of the early design concepts:

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          Detailed wireframes were created using <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/7PxChlnNKudq9ZiaobhNh0/Logichainge?type=design&node-id=1625%3A11348&t=67inQ6Sl1knCeJVp-1" target="_blank">Figma</a>  to showcase the main features and functionalities of the Groupage TMS
          module. These wireframes underwent iterative improvements based on feedback from stakeholders. Take a look at the
          wireframes below:

        <p>
          An interactive prototype was developed to showcase the design and user flow within the module. The prototype
          underwent rigorous evaluation and refinement based on stakeholder feedback. Explore the evolution of the prototype
          below:
        </p>
        <div class="image-gallery" id="prototype-gallery"></div>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">User Flow & Feedback</h3>
        <p>As the prototype was growing, so did the user flow for it. As stated before, our idea was to creat a and easy to use module that allowed our users
          to easily complete their tasks with minimal effort. Making it intuitive meant that the user flow needed to be cohesive and have a clear learning curve. 
          We needed the user to feel that the system was built solely for them, that A to B was the path they were following, even if that meant going through C and D.
          The user is in control and that is how they should feel while using our system.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>Feedback was received after user testing with stakeholders within Logichainge. The prototype underwent numeruous changes due to this and industry research.
          Many of the changes integrated in the final prototype were implemented into the PoC in development.
